# plint to-do list

- Add an AGPL header to all the .py files.
- Rewrite to handle filtering and DAV search string without duplicate code.
    - At the same time, rewrite so that you don't need to use assert_warn to print a warning.
    - warning(message, dav_keyword) will add dav_keyword to list and display the message.
- For `--spec`, also check that each element has a reference number. If an element does not, that could indicate a drawing objection is needed for that element.
- Reorganize code to have unit tests for everything including the antecedent basis checking.
- Look at overlap of claim elements between independent claims to see if a restriction can be made.
- Check for invalid multiple dependencies.
- Check for features of other softwares.

- `--reject` option to write rejections to text file. Then you can delete the ones you don't want.
- "Use" claim detection: method or process without word step?
- Check classification for patent documents on patent analysis for more ideas.
- Check for synonyms of the relative terms you already have for more.
- With `--spec`, one could use proximity to 112(f) terms to determine which elements are functionally defined. Then one could count the number of times that element is mentioned in the specs to get an estimate for how detailed the description is. If it's not presented in detail, then that could lead to a 112(a) or 112(b) problem.
- With `--spec`, could also check for patent profanity, but that's low priority as it wouldn't help me as an examiner.
- Add `--stats` to print out the number of words in each claim and other statistics.
- Add ability to annotate the claim to ignore a particular word for the warnings file. Add this to the documentation after doing so: If a user wishes to prevent rules from being applied to a particular word, they can add "#" to the beginning of the word. For example, they could change *element* to *#element*.
- Look at typo for ideas: Statistical method of finding mistakes in patent claims? <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6593963>
- Look at readability indices to identify convoluted parts of claims to double check.

    - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46759492/syllable-count-in-python>
    - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index>: No syllables needed.
- Detect ranges of numbers, print warning when multiple are found in one claim as that could indicate a 112(b) issue. For dependent claims, check that the range is fully within the range of the independent claims. See TC 3700 112(b) refresher for examples.
- Print some checks for equations like dimensional homogeneity, no singularities.
    - `\b(equation|formula)\b`
    - `=`

- vague terms, check how defined in specs or else they might have 112 issues: amount, quantity, substance, material, device, module, element, member (could be 112(f))
- Think about how to reduce the amount of manual annotation needed.
    - Get ends of claim elements from numbered elements in specs? Scan specs for text between a/an and a number?
- Check for preamble-limiting terms. Annotate the end of the preamble to find them? First punctuation mark ends the preamble?
