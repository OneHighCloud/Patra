# plint to-do list

- Check for invalid multiple dependencies.
- Check for features of other softwares.
- `--reject` option to write rejections to text file. Then you can delete the ones you don't want.
- "Use" claim detection: method or process without word step?
- Check classification for patent documents on patent analysis for more ideas.
- Check for synonyms of the relative terms you already have for more.
- Optional argument `--specs` to check that each element is mentioned in the specs.
- For `--specs`, also check that each element has a reference number. If an element does not, that could indicate a drawing objection is needed for that element.
- Add `--stats` to print out the number of words in each claim and other statistics.
- Add ability to annotate the claim to ignore a particular word for the warnings file. Add this to the documentation after doing so: If a user wishes to prevent rules from being applied to a particular word, they can add "#" to the beginning of the word. For example, they could change *element* to *#element*.
- Look at typo for ideas: Statistical method of finding mistakes in patent claims? <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6593963>
- Look at readability indices to identify convoluted parts of claims to double check.
    - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability>
    - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46759492/syllable-count-in-python>
    - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index>: No syllables needed.
- Detect ranges of numbers, print warning when multiple are found in one claim as that could indicate a 112(b) issue. For dependent claims, check that the range is fully within the range of the independent claims. See TC 3700 112(b) refresher for examples.
- Print some checks for equations like dimensional homogeneity, no singularities.
    - `\b(equation|formula)\b`
    - `=`
- Check alderucci_using_2020 for more ideas.

- vague terms: amount, quantity, substance, material
- Rewrite to handle filtering and DAV search string without duplicate code.
    - At the same time, rewrite so that you don't need to use assert_warn to print a warning.
    - warning(message, dav_keyword) will add dav_keyword to list and display the message.
- Think about how to reduce the amount of manual annotation needed.
    - Get ends of claim elements from numbered elements in specs? Scan specs for text between a/an and a number?
- Reorganize code to have unit tests for everything including the antecedent basis checking.
- Allow annotation to make "upper and lower nozzles" (in 17201601) introduce an upper nozzle and a lower nozzle.
- Check for preamble-limiting terms. Annotate the end of the preamble to find them?
