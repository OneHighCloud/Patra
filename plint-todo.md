# plint to-do list

- Add documentation for the lexicographic definition detector.
- Formality_Checklist_not_508.pdf
- Analyze abstract for compliance with rules.
- The title and abstract in the JSON file don't have to be files; they can simply be the title and abstract themselves. If the title or abstract variables end in `.txt`, then the associated text files will be read instead.
- Create spec.csv for warnings in the spec.

    - use `\s` instead of space
- Add an intro to regex in the docs:
    - `\b`
    - `\B`
    - `\w`
    - `\s`
    - `.`
    - alternatives like (case A|case B)
    - not matching these cases like `\bup to (?!including|excluding|and including|and excluding)\b`
    - matching anything between: `.*`, `(.+?)`, `\w*`, others that are more narrow?
- Check existing rules to see if they can be made more narrow with the `?!` notation to exclude certain valid forms. I recall wanting to do something like this before but not figuring out the right regex.
    - Things with the message "Possible indefinite parameter if type not specified" could meet this. For example, "volumetric flow rate" should not match but "flow rate" by itself should match.
    - Also, check things with messages like "Possibly indefinite if what the aperture/apertures is/are in or between is not stated." "aperture in" should not match.
    - "Possible relative term. Could be indefinite if not stated in reference to something else. See MPEP 2173.05(b).": For example, "greater than" should not match but "greater" by itself should.

    - Discusses why minimum and maximum can be indefinite.
    - On the indefiniteness of minimum and maximum, also see: berry_from_2003
- For `--spec`, also check that each element has a reference number. If an element does not, that could indicate a drawing objection is needed for that element.
- Reorganize code to have unit tests for everything including the antecedent basis checking.
    - particular warning.csv entries
    - antecedent basis
        - "the" before "a"
        - multiple "a" for same element
        - dependencies get new elements
        - all elements found in a long claim
        - all elements found in a dependent claim
        - `{`, `[`, `}`, `]`, `|`, `!`, `@`, and `#` work
- Check for invalid multiple dependencies.
- Check for features of other softwares.

- Check classification for patent documents on patent analysis for more ideas.
- Check for synonyms of the relative terms you already have for more.
- With `--spec`, one could use proximity to 112(f) terms to determine which elements are functionally defined. Then one could count the number of times that element is mentioned in the specs to get an estimate for how detailed the description is. If it's not presented in detail, then that could lead to a 112(a) or 112(b) problem.
- With `--spec`, could also check for patent profanity, but that's low priority as it wouldn't help me as an examiner.
- Add `--stats` to print out the number of words in each claim and other statistics.
- Add ability to annotate the claim to ignore a particular word for the warnings file. Add this to the documentation after doing so: If a user wishes to prevent rules from being applied to a particular word, they can add "#" to the beginning of the word. For example, they could change *element* to *#element*.

    - > Another example shows the importance of carefully choosing alternative language when drafting claims. In Kustom Signals, Inc. v. Applied Concepts, Inc.,5 Kustom Signals added the limitation “selecting either a greatest magnitude or highest frequency search” to the claim during prosecution and later sued Applied Concepts for patent infringement. But Applied Concept’s device searched both magnitude and frequency. The Federal Circuit reasoned that “or” is not “and/or” and the claim only covered a choice between either one of two alternatives, not both. The Court then affirmed a ruling of noninfringement by Applied Concept’s device. The outcome was indeed unfortunate for Kustom Signal, but it could have avoided the problem by carefully drafting the claim to read, for example, “selecting at least one of a greatest magnitude search and a highest frequency search.”

## Specification

Make patent drafting diction database. Put appropriate case law in the comment. Label as "patent profanity" as that term seems to be in common use. If unclear about why someone included a particular term, ask on the Patents Stack Exchange.

- Google search for "patent profanity" (no quotes).
- Include relative phrases.
- "Trans fat" problem with "patent profanity": a term is replaced by something that is untested and could be worse. (Analogous to trans fats being used to replace saturated fats, when trans fats are worse.)

        - ...but the root of the problem is vagueness, not the particular word used: > While “circuit” or “circuitry” may help avoid interpretation under § 112(f), it is advisable to provide a detailed description with sufficient structure and, as applicable, sufficient description of algorithms, to avoid a finding of indefiniteness in violation of § 112(b).
- "etc." could be 112b issue and also signals that you should list more possibly embodiments, for example, this is not good as it does not list a condensate drain as a possibility:

    - conventional, well-known, well known, known in the art (perhaps "known" by itself)
    - If the information is well known, then not saying so in a patent application is a way to increase the chances of being granted an invalid patent. If the information is well known then someone could easily challenge the validity of a patent. I don't like strategies that are basically ways to be granted invalid patents.
- Detect criticality in the specification.
- Have two CSV files for the specification. One looks for things like limiting phrases which are not relevant to patent examination. The other looks for things like criticality that are relevant to examination.
- Lexicographic definition identification for spec.
    - `\bmeans (?!for|to)\b` (to reduce false positives, though likely this still has many false positives)
    - Check for quotes? `"`, `“`, `”`
    - US20200208875A1 para. 0055: > Here, the heat-insulating side plates 61 are used with the meaning of side plates to which the heat-insulating pipes 50 are disposed to be adjacent, rather than the meaning of side plates that reduce the amount of heat transferred to the outside, thereby achieving thermal insulation.
        - This one was annoying!
    - Print entire line with definition in the output? Many lines will have multiple matches, so probably best to first identify all matching lines, and then print those lines. That would avoid duplicates.
